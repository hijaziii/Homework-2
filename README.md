# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

# Directions 

I Used the CSS Framework to creat a moble responsive portfolio.
Steps :

* I have greated the following files : `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* I used Bootstrap to develop my portfolio site by adding a:

- Navbar contains a Logo and links to About, Portfolio, and Contact pages. When reaching 767px with and belwo you will see a hambuger menu on the left of the Navbar that will include links to About, Portfolio and Contact pages.When you press on the logo it will aways takes you to About page. Navbar is consistent on each page.

- Resposive layouts such as (Cards), inserting my personal and my projects images in to it and adding some details about my pesonal life history and already done projects (Apps) with a link.

- I used Bootstrap's grid system such as containers, rows, and colums that will go along all size screen.

- By using Bootsrap I made a sticky footer. It will be stickon the bottom with all window sizes.

* I used semantic HTML using header,section, nav, and a footer etc..

* I styled my site (color, fonts etc...) in the following file (style.css).

* I also added media queries on the bottom of style.css that will change the color of my site when reaching 1024px with and below.

* That is mainly about everything I did in this project. Thank You!
